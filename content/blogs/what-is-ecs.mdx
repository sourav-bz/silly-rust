This is my first blog post after migrating from Substack to my self-hosted solution.

## Why I Made the Switch

There were several reasons for moving away from Substack:

1. More control over my content
2. Better SEO optimization
3. Custom domain with full ownership

## What's Next

In the coming weeks, I'll be sharing more about:

- Topic A
- Topic B
- Topic C

Stay tuned!
